👋 Hello, my name is Piotr Lisowski, I’m full time Java Developer.

Here you can find my old and little embarrassing recruitment tasks, before I found first job in 2021.

I also recently started to publish my Flutter code. But first of all, I'm learning, and secondly - I'm a backend developer :) So the quality of these apps will definitely be good, but it will take some time.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter/Dart
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some kind of nice Flutter project
- 📫 How to reach me: PM!
